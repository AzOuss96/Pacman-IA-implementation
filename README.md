# AI-pacman-implementation
This repository contains all my implementations of AI algorithms in Pacman game.

In this part, Pacman is chasing invisible ghosts using Bayesian inference with data provided by its sensors. 
## Exact inference :
In this first part, Pacman updates its beliefs of the ghosts distribution using only his sensors' data.
